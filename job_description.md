Position: Junior Software Developer

Salary: $40,000 - $50,000 / year

Overview:

We are looking for an entry-level software developer who is self-motivated and eager to learn. We work with a diverse array of clientele from Fortune 500 companies to small nonprofits, and this role primarily involves working directly with customers as a software consultant. The ideal candidate is a self-starter who is comfortable adapting to the changing needs of a fast-paced startup. In a typical week, you might be asked to lead the development of a custom application, or work on a larger feature in collaboration with our product team(s). We are looking for someone who can take initiative and solve problems on their own, but also knows when to ask questions and reach out to the team for help. Our team is growing fast and we are looking for someone who is willing to take advantage of this exciting opportunity to grow with us.

Note: All applicants must be authorized to work in the United States on a full-time basis for any employer.

Technologies:

We believe in choosing the best technologies to fit our customers’ requirements, which means our tech stack is constantly evolving. In the past we have built applications in NodeJS, Ruby on Rails, React Native, C#, Golang, and even plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Our developers should have an understanding of how to work with databases, and some basic knowledge of database design. We use agile project management methodologies and work in 2-3 week sprints, either individually or with a small team of developers led by a project manager.

Candidate must have:

1-2 years of software development working experience (or a degree in Computer Science plus relevant internships).
Proficiency in one or more of the following languages: Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C#, Golang.
Working knowledge of HTML, client-side JS, and CSS.
Basic proficiency in SQL.
Excellent communication skills (both written and verbal). This role involves translating technical problems into language that can be understood by non-technical stakeholders.
Excellent troubleshooting skills. Candidates must demonstrate the ability to consolidate information from different sources to solve complex problems.
The ability to learn quickly in a fast-paced and demanding environment.
The ability to complete assigned tasks with minimal direction and oversight.
The ability to work in close collaboration with a small (4-6 person) team.
Big plus if you have:

Experience working with telephony or Contact Center technologies, especially Cisco products or communications APIs like Twilio.
Experience in a client-facing consulting role.
Experience building, deploying, and/or maintaining SaaS applications.
Working knowledge of front-end web frameworks (React, Angular, Vue).
Working knowledge of back-end web frameworks (Rails, NodeJS, Django).
Experience with relational databases, non-relational databases, and/or ORMs (PostgreSQL, mySQL, SQLite, Redis, MongoDB, Firebase, ActiveRecord, GraphQL)
Experience with a distributed version-control system (Git, BitBucket).
Experience with agile project management methodologies (JIRA, Trello, Asana).
Cloverhound is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All employment decisions are made based on business needs and job requirements without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran or disability status. Applicants of all ages are encouraged to apply. We’re an open-minded meritocracy and if that sounds like a place where you want to work, we want you.
